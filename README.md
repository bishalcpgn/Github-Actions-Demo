# REST API Project

This repository contains the source code for a REST API built with Node.js and is used as a reference for the Medium article. 

For a detailed guide and explanation of the project's implementation, please refer to the accompanying [Medium article](https://medium.com/@bsal_cpgn/deploy-node-js-application-to-ec2-using-github-actions-217d2d82d151).

Self-hosted runner on the AWS EC2 has been terminated so, future deployment may fail. You may check previous deployments if you are here from the medium article.
